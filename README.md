-- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sipbuu
- Info
- You probably see that I have "copied" some files from @jojoxoop. Well, this is my new main account and I will be moving/forwarding most of that stuff onto this account and will update my old profile to my new main one.
- Code
- I mainly do javascript, python, html, and lua.
- Projects
- I'm not working on any "big" projects but I am working on some roblox games over at my roblox account (@waamoment)
